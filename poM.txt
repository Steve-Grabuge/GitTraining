Git, a tool for version control,
Tracks changes, makes life whole.
In training we learn its ways,
To merge, branch, and track our days.
Git, our project's backbone strong,
Guides us through the code all day long.
With each commit, we grow wise,
Our code, secure, before our eyes.

Cyber threats loom large and near,
Git, too, is not immune to fear.
Hackers seek to exploit and steal,
Our code, our work, our every ideal.
We guard with care, we train and learn,
To keep our Git repos free from harm.
With strong passwords, patches, and more,
We fortify our code and keep the score.

In Git's world, where code does reign,
A mythical creature does remain.
The unicorn, with magic grace,
Brings joy to code, in this sacred place.
Its shimmering horn, a symbol bright,
Of beauty, peace, and coding might.
Together, Git and unicorns unite,
A partnership of power, beauty, and light.

Crazy ponies, wild and free,
Gallop through the Git world with glee.
Their spirit fierce, their hearts ablaze,
They stand against the cyber maze.
With hooves a-stomping, manes a-flying,
They face the hackers, never denying.
Their passion drives them, their courage high,
They battle on, for the Git sky.

Their laughter echoes through the night,
Their tails a-whipping, full of fight.
The hackers cower, hide with fear,
For the ponies' bravery is clear.
With eyes aglow, and hearts on fire,
They stand as guardians of the Git mire.
Defenders of the code, they never tire,
The crazy ponies of the Git empire.
