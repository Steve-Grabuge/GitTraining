Git, a tool for version control,
Tracks changes, makes life whole.
In training we learn its ways,
To merge, branch, and track our days.
Git, our project's backbone strong,
Guides us through the code all day long.
With each commit, we grow wise,
Our code, secure, before our eyes.
Cyber threats loom large and near,
Git, too, is not immune to fear.
Hackers seek to exploit and steal,
Our code, our work, our every ideal.
We guard with care, we train and learn,
To keep our Git repos free from harm.
With strong passwords, patches, and more,
We fortify our code and keep the score.
